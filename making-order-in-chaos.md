# Making order in chaos
### The info-shaman manifesto
What you want? 
You **want** to **survive** otherwise the rest is useless. 
You want not just to survive but to **evolve** to  **improve** efficiency and conditions based on understanding of **reality**.

The **cause** and **effect** are indivisible. Without cause there is no effect. Without effect there is no cause. Without **consciousness** there is no **reality**. Without reality there is no consciousness.
Consciousness is a **mirror** of reality. Reality is a **projection** of consciousness.

**Reality** is a stream of **signals** which can be perceived, interpreted and organized by **consciousness**. 
Effective signals detection, **classification** and appropriate **response** improves chances to **survive**. By controlling the stream of events you controlling reality. Distinguish between familiar, new and repeating signals.   

Consciousness based on duality. Duality based on sensory threshold.
Consciousness can not accept something new without analogy with something familiar.

Everybody have different consciousness, capabilities and opportunities. 
Opportunities should be equal. But they not always are.
Truth is whatever you believe in. Believe it and it will become truth.

Distinguish between love, knowledge, belief, concept of god, religion and custom.
When you believe in something you believe to someone. That someone is rarely you.

**Love** is overcoming illusion of separation and sharing survival efforts.

After **knowledge** comes belief. After **belief** comes lie. After **lie** comes fear.
There is only one fear. **Fear** of death. On **physical** level - fear of **pain**. On **emotional** level - fear of **loss**. 
On **mental** level - fear of **unknown**. On **social** level - fear of  **excommunication**.
## Reason, mission and vision 
The **reason** comes from understanding the factors that improve your chances to **survive**.
It can be an **idea**, group of **people** or combination of factors. 

You **mission** is to combine your knowledge, skills and resources in order to adjust current state to desired vision. 

The **vision** is defined as detailed and as broad as your understanding of the mission, yourself and current state. 

Your current **state** is combined or affected from geographic location, time of the day, weather, age, gender,
nationality, socio economic status, education, professional knowledge, personal experience in unique proportions. 
Everything depends on your understanding of yourself. In which terms you define yourself? 
Are those social, biological, physical, chemical, abstract philosophical terms?
